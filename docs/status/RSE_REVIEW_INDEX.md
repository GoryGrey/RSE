## Recommendation Summary

### Executive Recommendation: ✅ PROCEED WITH LAUNCH

**Timeline**: 1-2 weeks  
**Risk Level**: LOW  
**Confidence**: HIGH (9/10)

**Why**:
1. Core technology thoroughly validated
2. Production-ready for single-node deployment
3. Clear product positioning
4. Killer app scenarios proven
5. Rust binding ready

**What's Needed**:
1. GitHub repo publication
2. Rust crate publication (crates.io)
3. Phase 3 roadmap execution (4 months)
4. Sales/marketing support

**What's NOT Needed**:
1. More testing (sufficient)
2. Kernel rewrite (solid architecture)
3. All bindings immediately (start with Rust)
4. COG or dashboard (defer)
