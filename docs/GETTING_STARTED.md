## What is Betti-RDL?

**Betti-RDL** is a space-time computation runtime with **O(1) memory guarantee**.

### Key Features

✅ **Constant Memory** - No matter how deep your recursion or how many events you process  
✅ **Thread-Safe** - Inject events from multiple threads safely  
Metrics captured per run; see logs.

✅ **Deterministic** - Same inputs always produce same outputs  
✅ **Multi-Language** - Use from Rust, Python, Node.js, Go, or C++

### Why Use It?

Perfect for:
- **Agent-based simulations** (logistics, epidemiology, crowds)
- **Neural network simulation** (spiking neural networks)
- **Recursive algorithms** (without stack overflow)
- **Event-driven systems** (IoT, message processing)
- **Grid-based computation** (cellular automata, spatial models)

fn main() {
    let mut kernel = Kernel::new();
    
    // Spawn a process at origin
    kernel.spawn_process(0, 0, 0);
    
    // Send it an event with value 42
    kernel.inject_event(0, 0, 0, 42);
    
    // Process events
    let processed = kernel.run(100);
    
    println!("Processed {} events", processed);

    return 0;
}
```

## Your First Program

Let's build a simple counter that demonstrates key concepts:

### The Counter Pattern

```python
import betti_rdl

# Create kernel
kernel = betti_rdl.Kernel()

# Spawn 3 processes at different locations
kernel.spawn_process(0, 0, 0)  # Process at origin
kernel.spawn_process(10, 10, 10)  # Process at (10,10,10)
kernel.spawn_process(20, 20, 20)  # Process at (20,20,20)

Metrics captured per run; see logs.

for i in range(10):
    kernel.inject_event(0, 0, 0, 1)
    kernel.inject_event(10, 10, 10, 1)
    kernel.inject_event(20, 20, 20, 1)

# Process all events
processed = kernel.run(100)

print(f"Processed {processed} events")
print(f"Process count: {kernel.get_process_count()}")

Metrics captured per run; see logs.

# So each process should have state = 10
```

**What's happening:**
1. We create 3 processes at different grid locations
2. Metrics captured per run; see logs.

3. Each process increments its internal state by the event value
4. After processing, each process has state = 10

---

## Core Concepts

### 1. The Grid

Metrics captured per run; see logs.

```python
# Valid coordinates: 0-31 for x, y, z
kernel.spawn_process(0, 0, 0)     # Origin
kernel.spawn_process(15, 15, 15)  # Center
kernel.spawn_process(31, 31, 31)  # Far corner

# Toroidal wrap-around:
# Coordinates wrap like Pac-Man
# (-1, 0, 0) wraps to (31, 0, 0)
# (32, 0, 0) wraps to (0, 0, 0)
```

### 2. Processes

**Processes** are stateful units that:
- Live at a specific (x, y, z) coordinate
- Maintain an integer state (accumulator)
- Receive events
- Can generate new events when they receive events

```python
kernel.spawn_process(5, 5, 5)  # Create process at (5,5,5)

# Send event with value 10
kernel.inject_event(5, 5, 5, 10)
kernel.run(10)

# Process state is now 10 (accumulated from event)
```

Metrics captured per run; see logs.

**Events** are messages that:
- Have a destination (x, y, z)
- Have a payload (integer value)
- Are processed in timestamp order
- Cause processes to update their state

```python
# Basic event injection
kernel.inject_event(x=0, y=0, z=0, value=42)

# Events are processed in order
kernel.inject_event(0, 0, 0, 1)  # Delivered first
kernel.inject_event(0, 0, 0, 2)  # Delivered second
kernel.inject_event(0, 0, 0, 3)  # Delivered third
```

### 4. Event Cascades (The Magic!)

When a process receives an event, it can generate **new events** for itself or neighbors:

```python
# Each event generates the next event (x=0 to x=9)
kernel.spawn_process(0, 0, 0)
kernel.inject_event(0, 0, 0, 0)  # Seed with x=0

Metrics captured per run; see logs.

# Each event generates the next one
kernel.run(100)

Metrics captured per run; see logs.

```

This is how you get **recursive computation without stack overflow**!

### 5. O(1) Memory

No matter how many events you inject or how deep the recursion:

```python
Metrics captured per run; see logs.

kernel.spawn_process(0, 0, 0)
kernel.inject_event(0, 0, 0, 0)  # Start cascade

Metrics captured per run; see logs.

kernel.run(1_000_000)

# Memory usage: EXACTLY THE SAME as startup
# This is the O(1) guarantee!
```

---

## Common Use Cases

### Use Case 1: Agent-Based Simulation

```python
import betti_rdl
import random

kernel = betti_rdl.Kernel()

# Spawn 1000 agents at random locations
for _ in range(1000):
    x = random.randint(0, 31)
    y = random.randint(0, 31)
    z = random.randint(0, 31)
    kernel.spawn_process(x, y, z)

# Each agent receives a "tick" event
for agent in range(1000):
    x = random.randint(0, 31)
    y = random.randint(0, 31)
    z = random.randint(0, 31)
    kernel.inject_event(x, y, z, 1)

Metrics captured per run; see logs.

for step in range(100):
    Metrics captured per run; see logs.

    print(f"Step {step}: {events} events")
```

### Use Case 2: Neural Network Simulation

```python
kernel = betti_rdl.Kernel()

# Create 32³ = 32,768 neurons (full grid)
for x in range(32):
    for y in range(32):
        for z in range(32):
            kernel.spawn_process(x, y, z)

# Inject sensory input (1000 spikes)
for _ in range(1000):
    x = random.randint(0, 31)
    y = random.randint(0, 31)
    z = 0  # Input layer
    kernel.inject_event(x, y, z, 1)

# Process spikes (will cascade through network)
processed = kernel.run(100_000)
print(f"Processed {processed} spikes")
```

### Use Case 3: Recursive Algorithm (No Stack Overflow!)

```python
# Fibonacci-like recursive computation
kernel = betti_rdl.Kernel()
kernel.spawn_process(0, 0, 0)

# Seed with initial value
kernel.inject_event(0, 0, 0, 0)

# Process until cascade completes
Metrics captured per run; see logs.

# But memory stays O(1)!
while True:
    Metrics captured per run; see logs.

        break
    print(f"Processed {events} events")

print(f"Total: {kernel.get_events_processed()}")
```

## Troubleshooting

### "Shared library not found"

**Solution:** Build the C++ kernel first:

```bash
cd src/cpp_kernel
mkdir -p build && cd build
cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
make
```

### "CMake not found"

**Solution:** Install CMake:

```bash
# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt-get install cmake

# macOS
brew install cmake
```

### "C++ compiler not found"

**Solution:** Install a C++ compiler:

```bash
# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt-get install g++

# macOS (install Xcode Command Line Tools)
xcode-select --install
```

### Binding fails to build

**Solution:** Ensure environment variables are set:

```bash
export BETTI_RDL_SHARED_LIB_DIR=/path/to/betti-rdl/build/shared/lib
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$BETTI_RDL_SHARED_LIB_DIR:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
```
